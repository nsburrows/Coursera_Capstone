    "The goal of this project is to locate which neighborhoods in Toronto are the best for people that are into fitness. This will be good for gyms and fitness trainers that want to narrow down their focus of which neighborhoods to market to as well as being useful for new immigrants when deciding a neighbourhood to settle down in. This project should address the issue of distance it take for a person to get to a fitness location in our near their neighbourhood. A long commute can be a turn off for many people and so the data provided here will match people that take their health seriosuly with the best neighborhoods for that lifestyle."
